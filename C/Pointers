//QUESTION
Objective

In this challenge, you will learn to implement the basic functionalities of pointers in C. A pointer in C is a way to share a memory address among different contexts (primarily functions). They are primarily used whenever a function needs to modify the content of a variable, of which it doesn't have ownership.

In order to access the memory address of a variable, , we need to prepend it with  sign. E.g., &val returns the memory address of .

This memory address is assigned to a pointer and can be shared among various functions. E.g.  will assign the memory address of  to pointer . To access the content of the memory to which the pointer points, prepend it with a *. For example, *p will return the value reflected by  and any modification to it will be reflected at the source ().
   
Task

You have to complete the function void update(int *a,int *b), which reads two integers as argument, and sets  with the sum of them, and  with the absolute difference of them.

Input Format

The input will contain two integers,  and , separated by a newline.

Output Format

You have to print the updated value of A and B, on two different lines.

Note: Input/ouput will be automatically handled. You only have to complete the function described in the 'task' section.

//ANSWER

#include <stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>

void update(int *a,int *b) {
    int temp=*a;
 *a=*a + *b;   
 *b=abs((temp)-(*b));
}

int main() {
    int a, b;
    int *pa = &a, *pb = &b;
    
    scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
    update(pa, pb);
    printf("%d\n%d", a, b);

    return 0;
}
